# Teemo Scout
The start of an application for the game League of Legends. By entering a summoner name you can see all the players in the current game.

Built upon the React Slingshot boilerplate.

TODO:
 - Build handler for API requests
 - Plan out request pattern.
 - Build basic views to show returned data


Simple Request Pattern:
 - Summoner to get ID from name
 - Current Game with ID

Future Plans: 
 - Node server to perform requests and deliver aggregated reply to client.
